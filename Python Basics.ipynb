What is Python, and why is it popular?\n","##### ---> Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python emphasizes code readability with its clean and easy-to-learn syntax, making it a popular choice for both beginners and experienced developers\n","\n","### Reasons for Python's Popularity:\n","  1. Easy to learn and read due to its simple syntax.\n","  2. Extensive libraries and frameworks for various applications.\n","  3. Cross-platform compatibility.\n","  4. Strong community support.\n","  5. Used in web development, data science, machine learning, automation, and more.\n","  6. Data Science & Machine Learning – Widely used in AI, ML, and data analysis with libraries like NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow, and Scikit-learn.\n","  7. Web Development – Frameworks like Django and Flask make backend development easier.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"v30fwfrGMUmR"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#### 2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n","\n","---> An interpreter in Python is a program that executes Python code line by line, converting it into machine-readable instructions. Unlike compilers, it does not generate a separate executable file. This makes Python dynamically typed, easy to debug, and platform-independent. The most common Python interpreter is CPython, but alternatives like PyPy and Jython also exist."],"metadata":{"id":"ySHZ1Z593n-I"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#### 3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n","\n","---> Pre-defined keywords in Python are reserved words that have special meanings and cannot be used as variable names, function names, or identifiers. These keywords are essential for defining the syntax and structure of Python programs.\n","\n","Examples of Python Keywords:\n","\n","    if, else, elif, while, for, break, continue, def, return, class, import, try, except, lambda, with, yield, True, False, None, etc."],"metadata":{"id":"ve3uA4Bw4ILc"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#### 4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n","\n","---> No, keywords cannot be used as variable names in Python because they are reserved words that define the syntax and structure of the language. Using a keyword as a variable name will result in a SyntaxError.\n","\n","Example:\n","\n","    if = 10  # ❌ SyntaxError: invalid syntax\n","    \n","#    # If you need to use a similar name, you can modify it:\n","    if_value = 10  # ✅ Allowed\n","\n","    # To check all reserved keywords in Python, use:\n","    import keyword\n","    print(keyword.kwlist)"],"metadata":{"id":"CmbfWowr4nxn"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#### 5.

Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n","\n","---> Lists are mutable, while tuples are immutable because of their internal memory structure and design principles.\n","\n","1. Lists (Mutable)\n","   - Stored as references to elements, meaning elements can be changed.\n","\n","   - Allow modification, addition, and removal of elements.\n","\n","   - Example:\n","\n","         my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n","         my_list[0] = 10  # ✅ Allowed\n","         print(my_list)  # Output: [10, 2, 3]\n","2.
